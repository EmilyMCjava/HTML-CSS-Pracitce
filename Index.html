                HTML:
                HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents 
                designed to be viewed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. 
                Technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages 
                such as JavaScript often help here.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or local 
                repository and convert the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML semantically describes the structure 
                of a web page and originally contained the guidelines for its appearance.

                CSS:
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe the appearance of a document 
                written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML, or XHTML). 
                CSS is the technology foundation of the World Wide Web, along with HTML and JavaScript. 
                CSS was designed to allow separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. 
                This separation can improve the accessibility of the content; provide more flexibility and control in defining 
                presentation features; Allow multiple websites to share formatting by specifying the appropriate CSS in a separate CSS file, 
                reducing the complexity and repetition of structured content. and turn on.CSS for caching to improve page load speed between 
                pages that share the file and its formatting.
